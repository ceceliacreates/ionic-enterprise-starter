For this guide to work, you will need to have a Native Plugin Key. If you do not have a key already, you can quickly acquire one through a [free 14-day trial](https://dashboard.ionicframework.com/personal/apps?native_trial=1)! With that settled you will have access to:

- [Auth Connect](https://ionic.io/docs/auth-connect): Add Single Sign-on using a variety of services including Auth0, AWS Cognito, Azure AD B2C, or any OpenId Connect provider.
- [Identity Vault](https://ionic.io/docs/identity-vault): Secure user identity and session tokens through encryption at-rest, unlocked only by biometric identity (FaceID/TouchID).
- [Secure Storage](https://ionic.io/docs/secure-storage): Add high-performance, secure data storage. Full SQL query support through SQLite and key/value support for simpler use cases.

## What will you build?

Your completed application will integrate all three solutions together. You will have untilized the entire Ionic Enterprise stack, including a great cross-platform experience powered by Ionic Framework and Capacitor, mobile CI/CD with Appflow, authentication powered by Auth Connect and Identity Vault, and data storage powered by Secure Storage.

## TL;DR

If you would like to jump ahead and get the completed code for your own investigation before you get started, you can grab it from [GitHub](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-enterprise-starter).
